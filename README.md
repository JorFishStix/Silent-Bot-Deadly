File dump for my flash drive during the 2023 - 2024 Over Under VEX Robotics Season

!DriveE and !UIL-SKILLS were the programs used at our final competition in the season

All programs coded and designed entirely by me for use by Granbury High School's 88847A team.
All files are available for use and reference.

Note: You will likely find a quote book at the end of every program here.
These are mostly inside jokes.
Pay no attention to anything located within them, they are not part of the programs.
